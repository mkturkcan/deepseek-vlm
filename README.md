  <p>Deepseek-VLM: Vision Language Models with Reasoning</p>
</h3>

Vision language models with chain-of-thought reasoning are just starting to emerge. Over the last few weeks, we have been working on an easy-to-run training platform for vision models. Deepseek-VLM is a proof-of-concept to train a model in a short amount of time.

Note that this is just the first checkpoint of a model currently under training.
